# ComplexNumber
calculates the result of a valid complex expression given as command line arguments

to be valid the complex numbers must have the one of the follow signatures:
  no1+no2*i
  no1-no2*i
  no1+i
  no1-i
  no1
  no2

the expression accepts operators: +, -, *, -
a valid expression is one that begins and end with a complex number, and between 2 every complex numbers is one single operator.
if the explession is not valid the program returns "fake expression".
